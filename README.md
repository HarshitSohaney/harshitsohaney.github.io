## The website has been deployed on https://www.harshitsohaney.com
### The wiki contains updates on the progress I've made on creating this webpage
### !! The search bar is still a work in progress, so it shows no results upon doing a search

## Next Steps
  1. Use the Spotify API to allow for track autocomplete and playing snippets of music
  2. Create a recommendation system with data gathered from played tracks
